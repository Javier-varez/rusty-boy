# A date with a Game Boy

When Panic released the playdate console, I knew I had to get one. I loved the retro look and feel of the console, but I knew there was one thing I needed. I needed to be able to play my old Game Boy games on it!

This talk is about the journey to Rusty Boy, a playable Game Boy emulator for the playdate, how I convinced myself to implement one, what the process was like, and why it is worth keeping retro games alive.
